Zirconia ceramics,true,Heating process which can sinter yttria zirconia ceramics,Sun May 14 00:00:00 IST 2023,"This research developed a hybrid heating process which can sinter yttriazirconia ceramics to nearly 100% of their theoretical density in a short time.Following optimisation of the process, a detailed comparison of theproperties and microstructures of conventionally sintered and microwavesintered samples of 3 mol% and 8 mol% yttria zirconia was performed.Identical thermal profiles were used for both types of heating. For bothmaterials, microwave heating was found to enhance the densificationprocesses which occur during constant rate heating.",17013fa6-1d7a-45f8-ae4c-292fbeb2b6db
